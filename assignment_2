## Insights:
#### Which areas of Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints? What are some reasons you can think of for these trends?
###### The areas with the largest amount of noise related complaints were Upper Manhattan (the Bronx) and Chinatown, two areas that are known for their minority populations, and being the cheaper areas to live in Manhattan. It is hard to say exactly what may be causing these increased rates of noise complaints, could it be that due to the predominantly minority population, people are calling in complaints at a disproportionate rate, or are these areas that much louder than the rest of Manhattan. In areas like Central Park it makes sense that there are little noise complaints, as there are no residential areas there, but why is it that other residential areas like the Upper and Lower East and West Sides or Gramercy have nearly half the amount of noise complaints. It also makes me wonder whether the lower cost of living is due to the noise, or the noise is due to the lowered cost of living.

#### What are some trends you noticed regarding the descriptor for noise complaints?
###### I noticed that of the categories we sorted our data into, the complaint documented the most was party related complaints, which does not shock me at all, considering the night life in New York City is so loud and vibrant. I also noticed that construction related complaints were most reported in the center of Manhattan (below Central Park and above Chinatown). Across the board there were very few complaints relating to animals or ice cream trucks, but where there were complaints were in predominantly residential areas like the Upper West and East sides, and northern Harlem. And of course since the other category included every other type of complaint they vastly outnumbered the four other categories. 

#### How did the additional data and map change or reinforce your insights from Q(1)?
###### I found the categories that the data was categorized into very interesting because other than the construction category I would categorize all the other categories as complaints that would be found in residential areas. Because of this I would say this only reinforces the curiosity I have about how these complaints are coming about, whether or not they are actually representative of reality, or if they are a result of racial discrimination.
