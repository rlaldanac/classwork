## Insights:
#### Compare the outputs for 2013 and 2019. What are some visible differences between these two time periods?
###### There is significantly more levels of nighttime light in 2019 than there were in 2013, the coastline is completely white, and the inland area in 2019 is just as dense as the coastline area was in 2013. 
            
#### Can you tell a compelling story as to what type of trends accrued in Singapore between 2013 and 2019?
###### Since population did not grow as much as the nighttime light did, it can be assumed that the light is not due to residential areas, so it could either be due to travelers and vacation spots, or recreational industries, or some combination of the two. 
            
#### Which land uses are most common in those areas that experienced the largest growth in nighttime lights between 2013 and 2019?
###### Hotels, bars, clubs, and even an airport. Though the airport was there in 2013, hence the nighttime light levels being roughly the same in 2013 and 2019.
            
#### Which neighborhood/area of Singapore would you recommend the retail store should locate in? Explain why?
###### I would definitely reccomend anywhere along the southern coastline, as that is where the most industry seems to be. There may be a lot of competetion, but the light levels suggest a lot of foot traffic which can easily mean more customers.
